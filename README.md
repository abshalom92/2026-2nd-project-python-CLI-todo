#Python CLI To-Do App

A simple command-line to-do application written in Python.

So far, I created a program file that does A LOT.
Next phase of project, I need to refactor the code into modules to organize the chunks. 
will make 2 addt'l files
storage.py # file i/o (load/save)
commands.py # app behavior (add, list, complete, etc.)
