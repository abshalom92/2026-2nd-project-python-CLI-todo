#Python CLI To-Do App

A simple command-line to-do application written in Python.

So far, I created a program file that does A LOT.
This to-do app can:
1. List tasks
2. Add tasks
3. Mark tasks complete
4. Delete tasks
5. List the available commands, with (-h)

As of 1/14/26, I feel pretty good about my progress with this project and what I learned about Python. 

Future state ideas; 
1. Unit tests with pytest
2. Add task priorities or due dates
3. Edit existing tasks
4. Add comments to tasks
5. Add status (i.e., in progress, stuck, getting help, wrapping up, etc.)
6. Re-order tasks (might be the same as priorities at the end of the day)
7. Add confirmation prompts (--force flags)
8. Package the app as an installable CLI tool
9. Send email notifications to specified contacts upon completion or status change
10. Assign tasks
11. Clear tasks list
12. Add subtasks
13. Add buckets of work
14. Noise when a task is marked complete
15. History of complete tasks previewed as a table
16. Date completed
17. Data insights and visualization. (i.e., showing who completes tasks, etc.)
